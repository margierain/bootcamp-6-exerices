# Exercises

A list of exercises for the bootcampers; covering major concepts.

## Algorithms

**1. Array Reverse**

Write a function `reverse(A)` that reverses a list `A`, of integers. However, with the
following constraints:

  - No use of built-in reverse functions
  - Without creating another array.

**2. Equilibrium**

A zero-indexed list/array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

```
  function solution(A);
```

that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

```
  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
```

the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

**3. Number to Words**

`num_to_word(438483478)` should output `four three eight four eight three four seven eight`

**4. Factorial**

Write a function `factorial(n)` that returns a factorial of a number.

**5. Sum of Digits**

Write a function `sum_of_digits(A)`, that takes in an array of numbers `A`, and returns the
sum of all the digits in the numbers. e.g. `[10, 20, 3, 5, 6, 23]` should return
`1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 = 22`.

**6. Sum of Unique Digits**

Write a function `sum_of_unique_digits(A)`, that takes in an array of numbers `A`, and returns the sum of all the *unique* digits in the numbers. e.g. `[10, 20, 3, 5, 6, 23]` should return
`1 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17`.
